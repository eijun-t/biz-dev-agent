# Task ID: 11
# Title: Integrate LLM Provider and Model Selection Logic
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Connect to OpenAI GPT-4o (or other LLMs) via environment variables. Ensure critical agents use the correct model as specified in env config.
# Details:
Use LangChain's ChatOpenAI wrapper. Read model names from .env (LLM_MODEL_CRITICAL for Analyst, Critic; default for others). Avoid hardcoding model names. Allow easy switching for development/testing.

# Test Strategy:
Switch model names in .env and verify correct models are used for each agent. Test fallback to default if critical model is not set.
