# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Passwordless Authentication Flow
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Build frontend and backend logic for standard email/password authentication using Supabase Auth.
# Details:
Create login and signup UI with shadcn/ui, supporting email and password fields. Signup must include email, password, and password confirmation. Use the Supabase client SDK to handle email/password authentication requests and session management. Leverage existing authentication-related files. Protect all app routes except login/signup, ensuring only authenticated users can access protected content.

# Test Strategy:
Attempt login and signup with valid and invalid email/password combinations, including mismatched password confirmation. Confirm session persistence and route protection. Verify that only authenticated users can access protected routes.
