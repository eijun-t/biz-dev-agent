# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Ideation and Initial Evaluation Agents
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Create Ideator and Critic agents for business idea generation and initial quality assessment, with autonomous iteration capability.
# Details:
Develop Ideator agent for business model generation based on research findings. Create Critic agent for initial idea evaluation and quality scoring. Implement autonomous iteration - Critic can request Ideator to refine ideas or Researcher to gather more information. Define evaluation criteria and scoring thresholds for progression to next phase.

# Test Strategy:
Generate multiple business ideas from research data. Test Critic evaluation accuracy and consistency. Verify autonomous iteration and quality improvement loops.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Ideator Agent Specification [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the Ideator agent's structure, including required outputs (title, target, problem, solution, business model), number of ideas to generate, and alignment criteria with Mitsubishi Estate's strengths and existing businesses.
### Details:
Specify the JSON output format, ensure the agent generates 3-5 business ideas, and incorporate evaluation for acceleration potential via Mitsubishi Estate's assets.

## 2. Develop Critic Agent Evaluation Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Implement the Critic agent to evaluate business ideas using defined criteria: market size/growth, feasibility/technical difficulty, strategic fit, competitive advantage, and profitability/ROI.
### Details:
Establish a 0-100 scoring system, set a 70-point threshold for progression, and enable selection of the top idea from multiple candidates.

## 3. Implement Autonomous Iteration Workflow [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Enable the Critic agent to autonomously request idea refinement from the Ideator agent if all ideas score below 70, with a maximum of three iterations.
### Details:
Design the workflow to track iteration count, enforce the three-attempt limit, and terminate the process if no idea meets the threshold after three rounds.

## 4. Integrate Agents with LangGraph.js and Asynchronous Processing [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.3
### Description: Implement state management and asynchronous communication between Ideator and Critic agents using LangGraph.js, ensuring robust error handling and retry logic.
### Details:
Set up LangGraph.js for agent orchestration, support asynchronous calls, and implement error handling to retry failed operations as needed.

## 5. Validate End-to-End Performance and Output Compliance [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.4
### Description: Ensure the entire ideation and evaluation process completes within 10 minutes and outputs results in the specified JSON structure.
### Details:
Measure total processing time from initial idea generation to final output, and validate that all outputs strictly match the required JSON schema.
