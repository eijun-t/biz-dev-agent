# Task ID: 10
# Title: Integrate Multi-Agent Orchestration and Workflow Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the complete multi-agent workflow orchestration system with dynamic routing, state management, and autonomous agent coordination.
# Details:
Integrate all agents into a cohesive workflow system. Implement dynamic routing logic allowing agents to autonomously decide next actions and coordinate with other agents. Create robust state management for information sharing across agents. Implement workflow progression logic (ideation research → ideation → evaluation → detailed research → report generation). Add comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms.

# Test Strategy:
Execute end-to-end workflows with various input scenarios. Test autonomous agent coordination and decision-making. Verify workflow progression and error recovery.
