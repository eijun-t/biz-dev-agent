# Task ID: 10
# Title: Integrate Multi-Agent Orchestration and Workflow Management
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the complete multi-agent workflow orchestration system with dynamic routing, state management, and autonomous agent coordination.
# Details:
Integrate all agents into a cohesive workflow system. Implement dynamic routing logic allowing agents to autonomously decide next actions and coordinate with other agents. Create robust state management for information sharing across agents. Implement workflow progression logic (ideation research → ideation → evaluation → detailed research → report generation). Add comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms.

# Test Strategy:
Execute end-to-end workflows with various input scenarios. Test autonomous agent coordination and decision-making. Verify workflow progression and error recovery.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Multi-Agent Workflow Architecture [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the overall architecture for orchestrating multiple autonomous agents, including workflow phases, agent roles, communication protocols, and dynamic routing logic.
### Details:
Establish the workflow progression (Planner→Researcher→Ideator→Critic→Analyst→Enhanced Researcher→Writer→Enhanced Critic), agent responsibilities, and how agents will communicate and coordinate autonomously using LangGraph.js. Specify dynamic routing rules and fallback mechanisms for error handling and workflow reversions.

## 2. Implement Shared State Management and Information Exchange [done]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Develop robust shared state management to enable seamless information sharing and coordination among agents throughout the workflow.
### Details:
Utilize LangGraph.js SharedState interfaces and Supabase for persistent state. Ensure agents can read/write shared context, track workflow progression, and access necessary data for decision-making.

## 3. Develop Dynamic Routing and Autonomous Coordination Logic [done]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Implement logic that allows agents to autonomously decide next actions, coordinate with other agents, and dynamically route tasks based on workflow state and quality criteria.
### Details:
Configure LangGraph.js to support flexible agent-to-agent routing, including parallel and conditional flows. Integrate quality checks to trigger phase reversions or alternate paths as needed.

## 4. Integrate Real-Time Monitoring, Progress, and Error Reporting [done]
### Dependencies: 10.3
### Description: Build real-time monitoring and logging features to display agent progress, workflow state, and detailed error information to users.
### Details:
Implement WebSocket/SSE-based updates for agent status, error locations, and progress. Display quality scores, estimated completion times, and allow user interruption or correction.

## 5. Implement Comprehensive Error Handling and Recovery Mechanisms [done]
### Dependencies: 10.3
### Description: Develop robust error detection, handling, and recovery logic to ensure workflow resilience against agent/API failures and timeouts.
### Details:
Add mechanisms for retrying failed tasks, rolling back to previous workflow phases, and escalating persistent issues. Ensure all errors are logged with detailed context for debugging.

## 6. Integrate User Interaction and Feedback Controls [done]
### Dependencies: 10.4, 10.5
### Description: Enable user-driven workflow controls, including the ability to issue correction instructions, pause/resume workflows, and view quality assessments.
### Details:
Implement UI components for user feedback, correction input, and workflow control. Ensure user actions are reflected in agent coordination and workflow state.
