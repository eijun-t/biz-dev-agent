# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Report Generation and Quality Assurance System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Create Writer agent for comprehensive report generation and enhanced Critic for final quality assurance, with autonomous revision capabilities.
# Details:
Develop Writer agent for HTML report generation using structured templates. Include all required sections: idea summary, target market, competitive landscape, financial projections, risks, implementation roadmap. Enhance Critic agent for final quality assessment and revision requests. Implement autonomous revision loops - Writer can request additional research or analysis if needed.

# Test Strategy:
Generate complete reports from analysis data. Test report quality and completeness. Verify autonomous revision and improvement processes.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Writer Agent UI and Template Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design the Writer agent's user interface with a modern gradient background and tab-based layout, implementing 7 fixed tabs as specified. Define the HTML/React template structure for detailed report content in each tab.
### Details:
Ensure the UI uses Next.js 15, React, TailwindCSS, and shadcn/ui components. Each tab must correspond to a required report section and support detailed content entry. Include a right sidebar for chatbot Q&A based on report content.

## 2. Implement HTML Report Generation Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Develop the Writer agent's logic to generate structured HTML reports using the defined templates, populating all required sections with data.
### Details:
Ensure each tab's content is rendered in HTML/React format only. Integrate template logic to support dynamic data population and formatting. Support saving and loading reports from Supabase.

## 3. Integrate Chatbot Functionality for Report Q&A [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Implement a chatbot in the right sidebar that answers questions based on the current report's content.
### Details:
Ensure the chatbot can access and reference all report sections. UI must remain responsive and context-aware.

## 4. Develop Enhanced Critic Agent for Quality Assessment [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2
### Description: Create the Critic agent to evaluate reports for logical consistency and actionable specificity, scoring each report and providing revision requests if below the 80-point threshold.
### Details:
Implement evaluation logic focusing on logical coherence and concrete details. Critic must provide actionable feedback and trigger revision requests as needed.

## 5. Implement Autonomous Revision and Research Loop [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.4
### Description: Enable the Writer agent to autonomously request additional research or analysis and revise reports up to two times based on Critic feedback.
### Details:
Track revision count and enforce a maximum of two cycles. Ensure Writer can trigger targeted research or analysis requests and update the report accordingly.

## 6. Optimize Performance, Error Handling, and Data Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2, 9.5
### Description: Optimize report generation and QA processes for speed and reliability. Implement robust error handling and fallback logic for missing data. Ensure all reports are saved and managed in Supabase.
### Details:
Balance processing time and output quality. Handle incomplete data gracefully. Confirm all report data is stored and retrievable from Supabase in HTML/React format.
