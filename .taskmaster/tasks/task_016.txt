# Task ID: 16
# Title: Add Observability, Error Handling, and Cost Guardrails
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Log token usage and failure counts to 'logs' table. Implement retry logic for LLM errors (up to 3 times) and enforce monthly API token cap.
# Details:
Instrument agent workflow to log token counts and errors. On LLM failure, retry up to 3 times, then mark as 'failed'. Implement backend check to halt generation if token cap is exceeded.

# Test Strategy:
Simulate LLM errors and high token usage. Verify retries, logging, and cap enforcement work as intended.
