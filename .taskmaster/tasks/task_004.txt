# Task ID: 4
# Title: Design Database Schema for Reports, Scores, and Logs
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Define and migrate the schema for 'reports', 'scores', and 'logs' tables in Supabase Postgres.
# Details:
Design 'reports' to store generated report data, 'scores' for user evaluations (including per-criterion scores and comments), and 'logs' for observability (token usage, failures). Use SQL migrations or Supabase dashboard.

# Test Strategy:
Insert, update, and query sample data for each table. Validate schema constraints and relationships.
