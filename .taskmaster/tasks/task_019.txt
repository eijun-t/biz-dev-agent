# Title: Implement Enhanced Ideator Agent for Multiple High-Quality Business Ideas
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 18
# Priority: high
# Description: 強化されたIdeatorAgentを実装し、包括的な調査結果を基に複数の高品質なビジネスアイデアを生成する。三菱地所の強みとシナジー効果を最大化するアイデア創出を行う。
# Details:
Enhanced Researcherからのリッチなデータセットを活用し、5-8個の多様なビジネスアイデアを生成。各アイデアは詳細なビジネスモデル、価値提案、市場ポジショニング、技術要件、実装ロードマップを含む。三菱地所の既存アセット（不動産、テナントネットワーク、ブランド力）との具体的なシナジーを明示。

# Test Strategy:
生成されたアイデアの独創性、実現可能性、シナジー効果を評価。異なる調査データセットでの一貫性を確認。

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Enhanced Ideator Agent Roles and Requirements [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Clarify the specific roles, goals, and functional requirements of the Enhanced Ideator Agent, ensuring alignment with Mitsubishi Estate's strengths, synergy targets, and user requirements.
### Details:
Document the agent's purpose, expected outputs (5-8 diverse business ideas), and required attributes for each idea (business model, value proposition, market positioning, technical requirements, roadmap, synergy with Mitsubishi Estate assets). Incorporate risk balance, business scale, and competitive analysis requirements. Use configuration files to manage Mitsubishi Estate information and ensure all user requirements are explicitly mapped to agent capabilities.

## 2. Design Ideation Workflow and Filtering Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design the step-by-step workflow for idea generation, risk balancing, profitability validation, and Mitsubishi Estate fit filtering, ensuring each stage is clearly defined and automatable.
### Details:
Map out the ideation process: (1) ingest research data, (2) generate a diverse set of ideas across balanced domains and risk levels, (3) filter for business scale (≥10B JPY profit), (4) assess and maximize synergy with Mitsubishi Estate assets, (5) ensure competitive differentiation. Define logic for risk balance control and filtering criteria as modular, testable functions.

## 3. Implement Enhanced Ideator Agent Core Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the core agent logic to generate multiple high-quality business ideas using the enhanced research dataset and the designed workflow.
### Details:
Code the agent to process input datasets, apply the workflow, and output 5-8 business ideas. For each idea, generate detailed business model, value proposition, market positioning, technical requirements (summary), and a three-stage implementation roadmap. Integrate configuration-driven Mitsubishi Estate asset data and ensure synergy analysis is included in each output.

## 4. Integrate Competitive Analysis and Risk Balancing Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Embed logic for basic competitive analysis (3-5 main competitors per idea) and ensure each idea set includes a mix of conservative, balanced, and challenging concepts.
### Details:
For each generated idea, automatically identify and summarize key competitors using available research data. Implement a mechanism to classify and balance ideas by risk level, ensuring the final set meets the required distribution. Validate that each idea's competitive positioning and risk profile are clearly documented.

## 5. Validate Output Quality and Consistency Across Datasets [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop and execute tests to evaluate the originality, feasibility, synergy, and consistency of generated ideas using different research datasets.
### Details:
Create test cases with varied research inputs. Assess each output for originality, business feasibility, explicit synergy with Mitsubishi Estate assets, and adherence to all requirements. Compare outputs across datasets to ensure consistent quality and adaptability. Document findings and refine logic as needed.
