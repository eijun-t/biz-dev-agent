# Task ID: 2
# Title: Configure Supabase Integration (Auth, Postgres, Storage)
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate Supabase for authentication, database, and storage. Enable passwordless email authentication and set up required tables.
# Details:
Connect Supabase to the Next.js project. Enable Row-Level Security (RLS). Create tables: 'reports', 'scores', 'logs'. Configure Supabase Auth for passwordless email (Magic Link).

# Test Strategy:
Test user signup/login via Magic Link. Validate RLS by attempting unauthorized access. Confirm data can be read/written to all tables.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Review and Update Supabase Project Settings [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Audit the existing Supabase project configuration and update only the necessary settings for integration with the Next.js project, ensuring no redundant changes.
### Details:
Leverage the current Supabase setup, making minimal adjustments to connect with the Next.js app and enable required features.

## 2. Design and Create Required Database Tables [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Define and create the 'reports', 'scores', and 'logs' tables in Supabase, using placeholder columns where detailed schema is pending.
### Details:
Implement initial table structures: 'reports' (columns TBD), 'scores' (1-5 score and comment), 'logs' (fields for AI agent logs, API usage, errors, performance).

## 3. Enable and Configure Row-Level Security (RLS) [done]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Activate RLS on the new tables with simple, permissive policies to start, ensuring basic data protection.
### Details:
Enable RLS for each table and add initial policies (e.g., allow authenticated users to read/write their own data).

## 4. Configure Supabase Storage (Initial Setup Only) [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Set up Supabase Storage buckets as placeholders for future use, without detailed configuration or integration at this stage.
### Details:
Create storage buckets in Supabase for later use, ensuring they are ready for future file uploads.

## 5. Integrate Supabase Auth and Environment Variables [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Ensure passwordless email authentication (Magic Link) is enabled and connect the Next.js app using environment variables managed via .env files.
### Details:
Verify that passwordless auth is active in Supabase, and configure the Next.js app to use Supabase credentials and endpoints from .env files.
