# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Ideation Research Phase Agents
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop Planner and Researcher agents for the initial ideation research phase, enabling dynamic investigation planning and information gathering.
# Details:
Create Planner agent for dynamic research planning based on user input (from broad to specific). Implement Researcher agent with Serper.dev + BS4 integration for web search and summarization. Focus on: startup trends, industry challenges, technology developments, investment patterns. Enable autonomous decision-making for additional research rounds.

# Test Strategy:
Test Planner with various input types (broad vs specific). Verify Researcher can gather and summarize relevant information. Validate autonomous re-planning capability.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement Planner Agent for Dynamic Research Planning [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a Planner agent capable of initiating research planning with or without user input, generating 20-30 balanced research items across specified categories using pre-prepared keyword combinations.
### Details:
Ensure the Planner agent can start from a blank state, generate diverse and balanced research topics (startup trends, industry challenges, technology developments, investment patterns), and exclude Mitsubishi Estate strengths from search queries.

## 2. Integrate Serper.dev API and BeautifulSoup4 for Researcher Agent [done]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Implement the Researcher agent to perform web searches using Serper.dev API (Japanese for domestic, English for overseas cases) and scrape detailed information with BeautifulSoup4 as needed.
### Details:
Configure API keys, handle language selection, and determine when to use BS4 for deeper scraping. Ensure structured JSON output for all gathered data.

## 3. Develop Autonomous Decision-Making System for Research Iteration [done]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Create a system that autonomously evaluates research sufficiency, determines Mitsubishi Estate fit, business scale potential, and decides whether to trigger additional research or proceed to ideation.
### Details:
Implement criteria for sufficiency (information volume, business scale, fit to urban development/real estate/customer network), and automate the feedback loop between Researcher and Planner or progression to Ideator.

## 4. Implement Parallel Processing and Performance Optimization [done]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Enable parallel execution of research tasks to accelerate information gathering, ensuring total processing time for the phase is within 2 minutes.
### Details:
Utilize concurrency frameworks to run multiple research queries simultaneously; monitor and optimize for speed and resource usage.

## 5. Add Robust Error Handling and Retry Mechanisms [done]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2
### Description: Implement comprehensive error handling and automatic retry logic for both Planner and Researcher agents to ensure reliability and resilience.
### Details:
Detect and handle API failures, scraping errors, and data inconsistencies; implement configurable retry policies and fallback strategies.
