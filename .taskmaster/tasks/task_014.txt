# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement Scoring and Feedback Mechanism
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 13
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enable users to score reports on each evaluation criterion (1-5) and leave comments. Save to 'scores' table and update agent memory for future loops.
# Details:
Add scoring UI to report view. On submit, store scores/comments in Supabase. Implement backend batch job to compute averages/variance and update LangGraph memory/prompts (no ML, just statistical updates).

# Test Strategy:
Submit scores/comments, verify persistence. Check that new agent runs reflect updated prompt examples/statistics.
