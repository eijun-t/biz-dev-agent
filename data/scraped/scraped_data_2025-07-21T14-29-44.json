        "content": "This is an address to pro palestinians\n\n  \nI never see, nowadays, pro palestinians call for a settlement, solution, or peace.\n\nAll I hear is \"drive them out\", \"destroy israel\". \"re-instate palestine\" and derivatives. Nobody is interested of talking about creative solutions, but let's talk about that realistically:\n\nAll nations surrounding israel tried to destroy it in 1948, 1956, 1967, 1973, 1982, 2000, 2006, 2009, 2012\\*, 2014\\*, 2021\\* and 2023-2025 and all FAILED.\n\n\\* Hostilities of a smaller scale\n\nAs a matter of fact, these wars simply destabilized surrounding nations such as Lebanon or Syria, rather than destablize Israel. A path forward of ditching enmities is the right one to STABILIZE the surrounding nations.\n\n  \nEven if we put aside historical experience, let's talk facts:\n\n\\- Israel is a technological fortress, with both the Iron Dome/Arrow/David's sling as air protection but also with smart border technologies (Yes, even including the Gaza '23 failure)\n\n\\- Israel, a nation of 10 million people that all live in a small dense area with population size double that of Sweden and density similar to Japan or The Philippines where 80%+ of people KNOW how to operate a gun from previous simple\\~advanced IDF training\n\n\\- Many people in Israel are armed and licensed to carry and also towns/cities have what's called \"Kitat Konenut\" which is an armed group of locals tasked with handling potential terror attacks and coordinate between them\n\n\\- Contrary to what you may think, Israelis are extremely resilient - Many of them are well aware / have gone through phases of war, have immediate shelters nearby,and as a mentality \"have nowhere else to go\" \n\n\\- Israel is a rich country, with one of the highest GDP in the world and they definitely have both \"deep pockets\" and \"a lot to lose\", you don't give up so easily on something you built and invested in so much\n\n\\- Love it or hate it, Israel is a western-alligned, NATO-alligned country and western nations have a lot of hidden interests with keeping Israel stable and secure (also a literal field research centre for advanced defense / military technologies)\n\n\\- Decisively, the last 2 years have shown a massive defeat to Hezbollah, Syria and Iran through enormous miltary advantage (as seen with air force, intelligence, commando raids and more) leaving Israel with very few willing enemies to take on (Hamas and Houthis)\n\n\\- Nuclear weapons, of course\n\n\n\nWhat makes you think in today's world a 10 million nation can disappear, or based on its record, give up after all this?\n\nJust as 6 million Palestinians are going nowhere, so do 10 million Israelis\n\n  \nWhy won't you give up this malicious idea, that ironically fits the ethnic cleansing definition, and realize it is simply not possible any longer? No matter how much you hate it, if you always call it palestine instead of israel on every single occassion or set up an imaginary countdown to 2027.\n\nWhy won't you understand, logically, that the only way to end Palestinian suffering is to CHOOSE a different path other than violence and war, which always was intiaited by palestinians and ended up with them suffering the most?",

As always, pull for/select characters that you like.**\n\n★★★ \\[Special Dreamer\\] Special Week\n\n* 20% stamina, 10% wit bonus\n* Unique Skill (Shooting Star): Ride the momentum and increase velocity (speed) after passing another runner toward the front late-race.\n* Lv 3 Potential Skill (Gourmand): Recover endurance mid-race (Pace Chaser/Betweener)\n* Lv 5 Potential (Gold) Skill (In Body and Mind): Increase velocity in the last spurt.\n* **Review:** Unexceptional mid-distance pace chaser. (Her commander version, which is provided for free as a story reward, is better than this version.) **Only pull if you want to be the best in Japan**\n\n★★★ \\[Innocent Silence\\] Silence Suzuka\n\n* 20% speed, 10% guts bonus\n* Unique (The View from the Lead is Mine!): Increase velocity by drawing on all remaining strength when in the lead by a fair margin on the final straight.\n* Lv 3 Potential (Concentration): Decrease time lost to slow starts.\n* Lv 5 Potential (Unrestrained): Increase ability to keep the lead on the final corner. (Front Runner)\n* **Review:** One of the only early game front runners, she does not reach her full potential until the Great Escape (or \"super front runner\"\\[?}) strategy is added to the game down the line. **Only pull if you enjoy the view from the front**\n\n★★★ \\[Peak Joy\\] Tokai Teio\n\n* 20% speed, 10% stamina bonus\n* Unique (Sky-High Teio Step): Greatly increase velocity with flashy footwork when closing the gap to runners ahead on the final straight.\n* Lv 3 Potential (Technician): Moderately increase ability to navigate smoothly. (Pace Chaser)\n* Lv 5 Potential (Lightning Step): Avoid becoming surrounded when positioned toward the back mid-race. (Medium)\n* **Review:** Unexceptional mid-distance pace chaser. She can be quite difficult to train in the first month of uma. **Only pull if you enjoy Teio Stepping**\n\n★★★ \\[Formula R\\] Maruzensky\n\n* 10% speed, 20% wit bonus\n* Unique (Red Shift/LP1211-M): Increase acceleration by shifting gears when positioned toward the front on the final corner or later.\n* Lv 3 Potential (Changing Gears): Increase passing ability when positioned toward the front mid-race. (Mile)\n* Lv 5 Potential (Step on the Gas!): Increase acceleration when passing another runner mid-race. (Mile)\n* **Review:** Basically the best miler umamusume in the starting roster, and perfectly viable for Short distance as well. Starting D Dirt aptitude can be raised to A pretty easily. Has one of the better inherited unique, but gets totally overshadowed by her Swimsuit version which also releases in Y1. **Worth using a pick ticket on**\n\n★★★ \\[Starlight Beat\\] Oguri Cap\n\n* 20% speed, 10% power bonus\n* Unique (Triumphant Pulse): Greatly increase ability to break out of the pack by opening up a path when positioned toward the front with 200m remaining.\n* Lv 3 Potential Skill (Gourmand): Recover endurance mid-race (Pace Chaser/Betweener)\n* Lv 5 Potential (Corner Connoisseur): Increase acceleration on a corner with masterful turning.\n* **Review:** One of two starters that have viable starting Dirt aptitude. Lv 5 potential is one of the best universal skills in the game. Inherited unique is decent because of its relatively easy to satisfy condition. Overshadowed by her Xmas alt, which terrorized JP CMs for a year. **Worth using a pick ticket on.**\n\n★★★ \\[Wild Frontier\\] Taiki Shuttle\n\n* 20% speed, 10% wit bonus\n* Unique (Shooting for Victory!): Increase acceleration with a pow, a wow, and a bang when well-positioned on the final corner.\n* Lv 3 Potential (Changing Gears): Increase passing ability when positioned toward the front mid-race. (Mile)\n* Lv 5 Potential (Mile Maven): Widen the margin when in the lead early-race. (Mile)\n* **Review:** The only other 3\\* in the starting roster with a viable Dirt aptitude. Good at short and mile distances. **Worth using a pick ticket on.**\n\n★★★ \\[Frontline Elegance\\] Mejiro McQueen\n\n* 20% stamina, 10% wit bonus\n* Unique (The Duty of Dignity Calls): Increase velocity with the determination to not be overtaken when positioned toward the front on the final corner.\n* Lv 3 Potential (Vanguard Spirit): Increase ability to maintain the lead when leading by a large margin mid-race. (Long)\n* Lv 5 Potential (Calm and Collected): Decrease fatigue early-race. (Pace Chaser)\n* **Review:** Long-distance pace chaser with rather uninspiring skills. Difficult to train in month 1 and actually worse than Gold Ship at time of banner. **Only pull if you're a Hanshin Tigers fan**\n\n★★★ \\[Emperor's Path\\] Symboli Rudolf\n\n* 20% stamina, 10% guts bonus\n* Unique (Behold Thine Emperor's Divine Might): Greatly increase velocity on the final straight after passing another runner 3 times late-race.\n* Lv 3 Potential (Dominator): Decrease velocity of runners ahead when positioned toward the back late-race. (Medium)\n* Lv 5 Potential (Professor of Curvature): Increase velocity on a corner with skilled turning.\n* **Review:** Unique skill's power is hampered by finicky activation conditions. Lv 3 potential is a debuffer, but Nice Nature is a better debuffer at mid distance in year 1. Lv 5 potential is one of the best universal skills in the game. **Only pull if you never want to graduate school**\n\n★★★ \\[Rosy Dreams\\] Rice Shower\n\n* 10% stamina, 20% guts bonus\n* Unique (Blue Rose Closer): Increase velocity with strong willpower when breaking out of the pack on the final straight.\n* Lv 3 Potential (Determined Descent): Moderately improve running on a downhill. (Pace Chaser)\n* Lv 5 Potential (Cooldown): Decrease fatigue by taking a breather upon entering a straight. (Long)\n* **Review:** One of 3 long-distance specialists on release, her Lv 3 potential is basically a dud in certain tracks. Guts is the weakest stat in early uma. **Only pull if you are a hero and not a heel**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cek99zica89f1.png?width=1129&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09cca92e6caa7a72be3f4a8d968e46f9db94e9b8\n\n# Support Card banner\n\n*Italicized* cards are solid and should sway your decision to keep an account, but aren't reroll targets. **Bold** cards are reroll targets.\n\n**Speed**\n\n[Biko Pegasus is the best in a weak release speed card lineup](https://preview.redd.it/9r977q6uec9f1.png?width=1457&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b479f0687ecf41330debc80680c4b7a2d956e080)\n\n* SSR \\[Beyond This Shining Moment\\] Silence Suzuka (Speed)\n* SSR \\[Dream Big!\\] Tokai Teio\n* SSR \\[Run(my)way\\] Gold City\n* SSR \\[Eat Fast!

[Welfare Special Week](https://umamusu.wiki/Game:SSR_Special_Week_(The_Setting_Sun_and_Rising_Stars)) speed is good enough to tide players over until then.\n\n**Stamina**\n\n[Super Creek is far and away the best card.

I have purchased books such as The Short History of Russia and Russia : Myths and Realities and honestly it left me even more bamboozled with just how unique your country is in every single way possible 😅 \n\nA commont trend I have noticed with Russia throughout its entire history is how it’s based on Moscow imperialism which has spread across modern day Russia and former USSR states as well as controling half of Europe during the Cold War. The other thing I noticed is how even during times when Russia was “allied” with the west, there were always tensions with other European countries. Even as of today, there is the SMO and border tensions with Georgia, Azerbaijan and even Japan (although imo, the Kuril Islands dispute is just Japanese cope, everybody knows it’s part of Russia). \n\nWith all of this in mind, I know for a fact that the Russian people aren’t dumb savages, you guys have internet, cities, entire societies and what surprised me is just how diverse and culture rich your country is which was only really surprising because when you watch movies or play games, Russians are always portrayed as evil oligarchs or drunk gopniks which is super unfair imo. I made tons of Russian friends here in the UK and most of them are smart people too and really not so different from other Eastern European countries (Poles especially would kill me for this statement lol). \n\nBecause of this, I was wondering, could you imagine Russia ever becoming a full on democracy (flawed or not isn’t important) or at the very least, a country that’s friendly with the EU nations where freedom of movement and trade could be implemented? \n\nIf yes, what do you think needs to happen and how could it be achieved?

in bad financial shape**. In the 2 years they have been funding it, Panda Energy has lost approximately $15 million keeping TNA afloat. Due to TV production costs and bringing in bigger names, TNA's losses have been around $200-250k per week in recent months. Other than WCW, no other wrestling company in history has burned through money at such a rate, and worse, TNA doesn't have a lot to show for it. Their only real source of revenue is the weekly PPVs (merch, ad revenue, etc. doesn't really amount to much) and it's clearly not enough. It's believed the recent Victory Road PPV did around 30,000 buys which they considered something of a success but they would need to run monthly PPVs at around 70-80,000 buys in order to stop the bleeding, and that's just not feasible right now. It's been said that people wouldn't be surprised at all if Panda sold the company or just shut it down entirely within the next 90 days. As mentioned last week, Impact is moving to bi-weekly tapings to save money while XPlosion is being retooled as a recap show.\n\n- **As for what's happening behind the scenes? DRAMA!** Jeff Jarrett and Dixie Carter reportedly don't see eye-to-eye on a lot of things and some have claimed Jerry Jarrett has tried to undermine his son because he feels Jeff is veering too close to the Vince Russo style of booking, while others have claimed Jerry is too old school and hasn't kept up with the last decade of wrestling and is out of touch. Jerry recently made Dusty Rhodes the head booker, which isn't helping him beat the allegations of being out of touch. Rhodes hasn't had a successful booking year since 1986 and everything he's booked since then, including large stretches of time as head booker of WCW, was mostly one failure after another. He's also had a habit of booking himself in top spots, which is the last thing TNA needs right now. There's people like Gabe Sapolsky out there, who is currently booking ROH and doing an incredible job of creating new stars, and he doesn't even get an offer. Just straight to what worked in 1986. Not that Dave thinks Sapolsky would leave ROH, but he's clearly the best booker in American wrestling right now and TNA never even considered him as an option. Meanwhile, Russo is totally gone from TNA and has told others that he thinks the company will die when Dixie Carter has her baby (she's pregnant) because he thinks she'll be too focused on her new baby to run the company. Dixie has also had to field complaints from other wrestlers who feel Jeff is booking everything around himself and some have threatened to quit if changes weren't made, which presumably played a role in Jerry making Dusty the new booker.\n\n- **Notes from tje WWE shareholder conference call**: profits were down this quarter, but the board of directors voted to double the dividend payout to shareholders, with nearly $6 million being paid out to Vince alone. WWE has managed to transfer their expensive ass Times Square restaurant lease over to Hard Rock Cafe, which gets WWE out of deal that was bleeding them of money every year. They have purchased 2 new scripts for WWE Films productions. The Triple H movie \"La Jornada\" is still expected to start filming in February (nope). Linda McMahon noted that the WWE 24/7 channel idea has been launched on a trial basis in certain markets in Pennsylvania but it doesn't seem to be a hit so far. They're hoping to get clearances in more locations before publicizing a huge launch for it. And a final note, a shareholder named Roger Schaffer of Molson Capital Management was banned from being on the call. The reason? In the past, Shaffer asked Linda several legitimately tough questions about WWE's creative slump around the time things were starting to plummet. They didn't like that, and as a result, he wasn't allowed to join the call this time.\n\n- **\"The Rise &amp; Fall of ECW\" DVD has been an insane success**. Dave hasn't seen it yet because he hasn't been able to get ahold of a copy. It sold out almost immediately in basically every store and has turned ECW into the talk of the business. So he doesn't want to review it himself until he's seen it, but the DVD has gotten rave reviews from every corner and at least two unnamed wrestlers who were vital to ECW's success have told Dave that it was a very honest and accurate DVD, something nobody could say about the Monday Night Wars DVD, which was full of revisionist history. From here, Dave shares a LOOOOONG review written by a long-time subscriber, and I ain't bothering with some rando's review.\n\n- **The success of the ECW DVD has got people talking again about a possible ECW revival under the WWE umbrella**. Dave talks about how they briefly brought ECW back during the botched Invasion angle, with Stephanie McMahon as the \"owner\" which basically killed that ECW revival from the start. They could try again and bring back ECW as a rival faction that feuds with WWE. Dave thinks that might work but you'd have to learn from 2001 and actually let ECW look strong for awhile instead of burying them immediately. They could also bring ECW back as a whole separate brand and Dave thinks that one \"simply isn't feasible.\" WWE doesn't have enough marketable talent for the shows they have already. Adding a 3rd brand would be insanity (lol). You couldn't book house shows. WWE house shows for Raw and Smackdown are already money losers, so ECW house shows would only do worse. They could rename Heat or Velocity and use that as an ECW show, but that wouldn't be cost effective and those shows have shitty time slots anyway that wouldn't sustain a whole separate brand. Plus, a WWE-version of ECW would never live up to the original because that style of show won't fly under Vince McMahon. Everything that made ECW the alternative is what WWE already copied a few years ago and are now trying to get away from (hardcore matches and whatnot). You could still have Heyman in charge, but what roster? Almost all the original ECW stars are washed up, banged up, and past their prime years. Several others are signed to TNA because WWE already didn't want them (Raven, Shane Douglas, etc.) And all the rest are names like CW Anderson, Steve Corino, Justin Credible, Danny Doring, etc. Most of those names don't fit into WWE's mindset of pro wrestling and WWE has never shown interest in hiring them in the past, and even if they do, are you really going to build a 3rd brand around guys like Chris Chetti and E.Z. Money? Several major WWE stars are former ECW alumni, but guys like Jericho, Benoit, and Guerrero are too important to WWE to be moved off of the primetime A-shows and put into an ECW revival that's doomed to fail. All of that being said, Dave does think that a one-time ECW reunion PPV would probably draw big for nostalgia reasons, but trying to revive ECW as its own standalone brand just doesn't make any sense (this entire paragraph is hilarious given what we know happened).\n\n- **Karam Gaber, the Egyptian amateur wrestler who won a gold medal in the 2004 Olympics, has turned down offers from both WWE and PRIDE, instead signing a multi-fight deal with K-1 to do MMA in Japan and will debut on the big New Year's Eve show**. It's rumored that he may face Kazuyuki Fujita and if so, Dave worries for Gaber. He'll instantly be the greatest amateur wrestler to ever cross over to MMA, but he has no striking or submission training and only a month to prepare. In the Japanese media, they're playing this up as a big coup for MMA and Japan. After Rulon Gardner also turned down a WWE offer to sign with PRIDE, the story in Japan is that WWE is falling behind when it comes to signing top prospects. Dave isn't sure Gardner would have amounted to much in WWE anyway. Gaber is another story,. He has a great look and a ton of charisma, and Kurt Angle was pushing hard for WWE to sign him. Dave thinks he might have become a star in WWE if he could get the in-ring part down, but alas, K-1 it is. When asked why he made the decision, Gaber said simply, \"WWE is not real fighting.\" So I guess we'll see how this goes for him (spoiler: Gaber gets knocked the fuck out by Fujita in 1 minute and never does MMA again. Fake fighting doesn't sound so bad now, huh?)\n\n- **There was a backstage incident between Bob Holly and Rene Dupree this week at a Smackdown house show**. But not all backstage backstage. There was a hardcore match with Dupree/Kenzo Suzuki vs. Holly/Charlie Haas. According to the reports Dave has heard, during the match, seemingly for no reason, Holly absolutely blasted Dupree with a hard chair shot that left the chair dented that left Dupree laying in a fetal position outside the ring. Holly then got down on top of him and began wailing away on him with legit punches that left Dupree's eye immediately swollen shut. Dupree, realizing he was being attacked for real, said \"fuck this\" and got away from Holly and walked out of the match. As he headed backstage while Suzuki and Haas went to the finish, Holly then chased after Dupree towards the back (while Suzuki and Haas were still in the ring) and there's reports that Holly tried to go after Dupree a second time backstage. The only thing Dave has heard from other wrestlers is that they're not surprised this happened and claimed that Dupree has a ton of heat in the locker room. A lot of the vets have tried to pull him aside and talk to him about whatever the issue is, but to no avail. Dupree is only 20-years-old and therefore unable to even rent a car in a lot of cities, and that's kind of an important part of the job. Evidently Holly let Dupree use his rental car and Dupree got some sort of ticket. He never showed up to court and a bench warrant was issued for Holly, who had to fly back to the city in question and appear in court to take care of the issue. It's believed Dupree never told Holly about the ticket and wasn't as apologetic about it as Holly felt he should have been. And, well, Holly decided to handle it in front of everybody. (Below is an excerpt from Dupree telling his side of the story).\n\n---\n\n[**READ: Rene Dupree discusses Bob Holly incident**](https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/2aeu4n/ren%C3%A8_dupr%C3%A8e_on_bob_holly_incident/)\n\n---\n\n- **As of press time, no word on any punishment**. Holly has plausible deniability in that he can claim he was just working stiff and didn't mean to hurt him, but it was clear to everyone watching that this was a premeditated attack. In fact, it's being talked about as one of those things that everyone in the locker room knew was coming except for Dupree. Holly is often used as the unofficial \"locker room enforcer\" by the company and this seems to be one of those situations. Undertaker, the Smackdown locker room's unofficial leader, defended Holly by saying he was \"just taking care of company business.\" Dupree is widely disliked and many felt this was his due punishment. Within the world of wrestling, this kind of thing isn't unusual but it's a perfect example of why wrestling is so different from the real world. Dave recaps the Tough Enough incident between Holly and Matt Cappotelli and notes that while some spoke out against Holly, there were a lot of wrestlers in the locker room who supported him there too, feeling that newcomers have to pay their dues and that's all it was. That's just the locker room culture baby. At least they weren't playing video games like a bunch of *nerds*, am I right?!\n\n- **Three Memphis police officers and a stripper are under arrest and facing a whole list of federal charges, one of which is an alleged attempt to rob Jerry Lawler's home**. The cops are accused of getting kickbacks from local clubs in exchange for warning them in advance of vice raids, transporting women across state lines for prostitution, meth and ecstasy distribution charges, and more. But the big story was that they were conspiring to rob Lawler's home along with a 21-year-old local stripper. The mastermind of the plot was police veteran David Tate, who is the son of local WREG news anchorman Jerry Tate. The stripper, a lady named April Veach, previously dated Lawler but is now dating Officer Tate. Veach informed Tate that Lawler kept $200,000 in cash stashed away inside two jukeboxes in his home, and that he's never there on Monday nights (due to being at Raw) so it would be an easy target. The plan was to station a police lookout car up the road who would then be able to warn the others of any 911 calls that were placed while the robbery was in progress.\n\n- **Somehow or another, federal investigators got wind of this plan and began monitoring Tate's phone calls**. He was heard discussing the plan with the other police officers who would be in on the robbery. Veach is a 21-year-old stripper and Hooters waitress that Lawler later admitted to having known for two years (....) and confirmed that she had been inside his home on multiple occasions. During the recorded phone calls, Tate allegedly said that he was willing to shoot Lawler or anyone else in the home if he had to, and also promised Veach a larger share of the loot since she knew where the money was stashed. They apparently discussed their plans with an undercover FBI agent as well. Tate claimed to own a Pizza Hut delivery uniform and planned to go to the front door disguised as a pizza man to confirm the house was empty. Needless to say, police intervened and arrested everyone before anything could happen. After the story broke, Lawler invited news reporters to his home and opened up his jukeboxes to show that there's no money hidden there (well yeah, not anymore). Lawler also confirmed he doesn't own a gun and said he was extremely alarmed at the news that they were willing to kill him if necessary (I remember this story when it happened, it was big news here locally).\n\n- **After 9 years of intense hatred and beef with Antonio Pena, hell has frozen over**: Konnan will make his return to AAA next month, teaming with Rikishi to face Cibernetico and La Parka. Konnan, the biggest drawing star in the history of AAA, left in 1996 to form his own promotion (Promo Azteca) and in the process, made a mortal enemy out of Pena. Seems they've finally squashed it though.\n\n- **Lots of people have been asking Dave if Mistico is eligible for the Rookie of the Year award in the Observer awards this year**. The answer is no. Although he began with the Mistico gimmick this year, he debuted in 1998 and was wrestling as Astro Boy as far back as 2001 on the main CMLL shows. So no, he's not a rookie. But he's damn incredible.\n\n- **Ron \"The Truth\" Killings debuted for IWA in Puerto Rico this week**, teaming with Konnan, and he did such a great job that they want him back ASAP. Usually, because he's so popular there, Konnan always gets the hot tags in his matches for the big pop, but by the end of the tour, they switched it around so Killings would get the hot tag because he had gotten so over with the fans. Time is a flat circle.\n\n- **Apolo and wife/valet Havana no-showed several recent IWA shows and are believed to be trying to jump to WWC**. However, IWA is insisting that they have Apolo under contract and he can't work anywhere else. There's a belief that he may be trying to get fired, but IWA won't fire him and instead have suspended him without pay (yeah, looks like that contract had him locked in. He eventually returns to IWA).\n\n- **Antonio Inoki has already given up on his hand-picked president for NJPW, Masakazu Kusama**. Inoki went to the press this week saying Kusama should resign and said his plans for running live shows in China will be a money-loser. Inoki also bashed HUSTLE for ruining pro wrestling and wasn't happy that NJPW recently worked with them, which was allegedly Inoki's idea in the first place but I guess he's casting blame on Kusama since it flopped. Speaking of, he defended his decision to change the recent Osaka Dome card around, saying the original lineup wouldn't have drawn at all. Most within NJPW disagree with that, feeling Inoki's last-minute changes resulted in canceling the 2 big matches people were looking forward to and replaced them with matches nobody wanted to see. The show didn't draw at all as a result, but of course, Inoki is taking no blame for that.\n\n- **Sabu was recently released from the hospital after spending 7 weeks there dealing with some sort of virus that left him partially paralyzed and unable to walk for months**. No one can really figure out what it was but Sabu is under the impression he picked up the virus in Puerto Rico while working down there. He's out of the hospital but not really doing much better physically. He's also in a bad financial situation because spending nearly 2 months in the hospital when you have no medical insurance is expensive. TNA's Scott D'Amore is working to put together a benefit show for him and a lot of TNA wrestlers are working it.\n\n- **Ernie Ladd's stomach cancer has gone into remission**. Last year, he was given 3-6 months to live but he beat those odds. A few weeks ago, before the election, Ladd got a phone call from President George W. Bush, who called to wish him well. Ladd has been a major activist and donor to the Republican party for years in Texas and knew Bush well from when Bush was governor and Ladd was doing ministry work in prisons.\n\n- **There's a new promotion called Fusion running a debut show in NJ in a couple weeks** and everyone believes Rob Feinstein is secretly behind it. Apparently one of the big tip-offs is that Tommy Dreamer will be appearing on the show, because he and Feinstein remain friends [(2025 update: yup, they're still friends)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/1ifc450/joe_sposto_rob_feinstein_running_tommy_dreamers/)\n\n- **Hey, speaking of...CM Punk worked an IWA Mid-South show and cut a scathing promo on Rob Feinstein**. Punk, who was wearing a Perverted Justice t-shirt (the organization that busted Feinstein), cut a promo saying he almost didn't work this show because Ian Rotten was selling IWA tapes to \"the boy toucher\" for him to sell, and he refuses to put money in Feinstein's pocket. But Punk said he's sympathetic to Rotten's situation (IWA is basically broke and got a life-saving influx of money by making a deal with Feinstein's RF Video) but Punk said there are other places to get IWA tapes. You can get them directly from IWA, from SmartMarkVideo, or if you really want, you can get them from \"the guy who tried to solicit a 14-year-old boy for sex.\"\n\n- **AP News ran a story on Joe Anoa'i, the younger brother of Rosey**. It noted that Joe is a 255-pound defensive lineman at Georgia Tech and has made 11 tackles for losses this season. In the story, he is quoted as saying he has no interest in going into pro wrestling (and thus, we never heard from Joe Anoa'i again).\n\n- **Randy Savage's deal with TNA is for 8 dates**. After he walked out following the PPV, he made several demands to return, which TNA gave in to (despite several in management thinking they were ridiculous). Savage gets limo service to and from his home in Tampa to Orlando for each show. His two \"security guards\" (Ron Harris and Brian Adams) get $1000 per night (more than many of the wrestlers are earning), and that Jimmy Hart can't be anywhere on the premises when he is there, nor in the production truck or on headsets when he is on TV. When Savage was out there this past week, he specifically had Harris watching the gorilla position to make sure Hart wasn't around. The whole time he was backstage, Savage only took his heavy coat off once and it was said his arms looked pretty shriveled up and that he's going to have to wear long sleeves if he actually wrestles because he's not anywhere close to ring shape. Savage also demanded his own private dressing room. All of these demands, TNA agreed to.\n\n- **On their tapings this week (the first ones booked by Dusty Rhodes), they directed fans to go online to vote if they should air the WWE footage they filmed at the commercial shoot**. Dave isn't sure about this move. The footage reportedly isn't anything special, and airing this on TV opens TNA up to a lawsuit that they would likely lose if they show any WWE-owned likenesses, and lord knows TNA doesn't need any other issues that require them to spend money. Dave just doesn't see the point (kinda the same vibes as AEW promising to show the Punk footage).\n\n- **WWE's upcoming New Year's Revolution show in Puerto Rico is already a success**. Fans began forming a line at 4:30am for tickets and when they went on sale, they sold over 10,000 within the first day (arena holds 18,000). It's also significantly more expensive than any IWA or WWC show (their tickets usually top out at $15, while the lowest for the WWE PPV is $40). Given the high ticket prices and the fact that WWE doesn't have much in the way of TV in Puerto Rico, this was thought to be a roll of the dice, but it clearly worked out. It'll be WWE's first show on the island since 1985 and they're expecting a molten hot crowd. Meanwhile, the Armaggeddon PPV for next week only has around 2,000 tickets sold as of press time.\n\n- **Bret Hart was interviewed on a radio show in Toronto**. He noted that the Hart family house has been sold and that it forced a lot of family members to let go of the past they had been clinging to. He also said he had no interest in ever working with WWE unless he receives a sincere apology. He's received private apologies from Vince but has always been skeptical of it, especially since Vince then goes out in public and continues to defend what he did and has never apologized publicly. When asked about Ric Flair, Hart said that he was never considered a good wrestler by other wrestlers. \"Must be a different group of wrestlers,\" Dave says. Bret then called Flair the \"ass wipe of WWE\" (thanks Beavis) and said he only rose to the top because of political connections.\n\n- **Notes from 11/18 Smackdown**: the Cena/Carlito match only lasted 24 seconds, since they had to get the US title off Carlito without him really wrestling. He took an FU and that was basically it. They referred to Kenzo Suzuki as a martial arts expert, which Dave points out is false, since Suzuki has literally never done any martial arts training whatsoever. But in WWE, every Japanese wrestler is a ninja. They had a capture the flag thing with the Tough Enough guys trying to get past the Bashams. All failed, but Daniel Puder came closest.\n\n- **Notes from 11/22 Raw**: this show opened with a WWE parody of the controversial Monday Night Football/Desperate Housewives opening with Trish Stratus, Shelton Benjamin, and Vince McMahon. (2025 update: if you don't remember this controversy, in 2004, the opening to MNF featured a tie-in with the show Desperate Housewives in which Desperate Housewives actress Nicollette Sheridan tries to seduce Philadelphia Eagles player Terrell Owens in the locker room. Because the world is stupid, this turned into a controversy not just because of the sexuality, but because of race. Owens is black, Sheridan white. Somehow, that became a problem for people and WWE decided to parody it). Anyway, WWE spent the whole week beforehand trying to alert every media outlet on earth that they were going to be doing this parody, but no one seemed to care and it got no mainstream publicity for WWE. But Dave thought it was at least pretty funny. Chris Benoit is the GM this week and booked himself a cage match with Triple H for the title. Triple H and Batista continued teasing issues with each other and 2 unidentified women were shown gossiping about it backstage. That would be diva search washout Candice Michelle and OVW's Melina Perez and Dave *really* hopes they're not splitting Melina apart from Mercury and Nitro because their act is perfect and they need to all be brought up together. Ontario indie wrestler Robbie McAllister also made a cameo (one of the future Highlanders). This all led to an angle where Batista pretended to attack Triple H backstage and turned babyface, which got Triple H out of the match. But then they revealed they were in on it together afterwards. Dave notes that this whole thing actually got Batista WAY over and the crowd was chanting for him like crazy. Way more effective than the Orton turn, and the Batista turn was a swerve.\n\n---\n\n[**WATCH: WWE parodies Monday Night Football/Desperate Housewives controversy**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSzHnvSD4ms)\n\n---\n\n- **Notes from 11/23 Smackdown tapings**: Daniel Rodimer was eliminated from Tough Enough, in a big surprise. Daniel Puder, meanwhile, got a bigger babyface reaction than everyone on the show except for Undertaker, and received loud \"UFC\" chants. They had arm wrestling contests with the remaining contestants and apparently Vince McMahon was running around backstage placing bets with anyone who would take him up on it that Puder would beat everybody (sounds like he did). Mike The Miz then cut a promo trashing Puder, which got him booed by the crowd. With his celebrity status, this was Miz's contest to lose and he may have cost himself by turning himself heel with the voting public. That's the only things of note from this whole show.\n\n- **Edge was on TSN's Off The Record debating the NHL lockout**. Edge said he respects hockey players more than other athletes but said all pro athletes are overpaid. He said he has to pay for his own rental and make his own hotel reservations, but he would never complain about that. NHL player Sean Avery, who was on the panel also, responded to Edge saying that wrestlers need to get a better union. When Edge responded that they don't have a union at all, Avery seemed stunned (yeah, Edge talking with pride about how he has to pay for his own stuff is peak WWE Stockholm Syndrome).\n\n- **Shelton Benjamin did an interview this week, confirming that he had no idea he was going to be Jericho's opponent at Taboo Tuesday until the results were revealed**. He also confirmed that he had no idea about the title change until about a minute into the match when the referee conveyed the news to both he and Jericho, and they called the rest on the fly (Jericho has confirmed all of this as well). He talks about Charlie Haas still being his best friend in the business and said he's going to be the best man at Haas and Jackie Gayda's wedding. He also says that back when they were a tag team in the OVW days, Haas had the hots for Gayda and made it known so it's cool that they ended up together.\n\n- **As noted from next week's Smackdown spoilers, Daniel Rodimer was cut from Tough Enough**. It was made clear to Dave weeks ago that even if Rodimer lost, he would still be getting a developmental deal. In a newspaper story, Rodimer talked about how he was uncomfortable with the Mae Young segment he was involved in and said he doesn't want to be involved in anything immoral on TV. \"Good luck, guy,\" Dave says. With a $1 million contract at stake, the contestants are starting to get a little aggressive and snippy with each other. Mike The Miz was complaining about the Bashams/capture-the-flag segment, saying he had to go up against both Bashams while they were fresh, whereas Daniel Puder got to go last, after the Bashams were already blown up from wrestling down the previous 4 contestants. Dave says there is some merit to that, but also Miz never stood a chance no matter what order it was. The Bashams absolutely turfed him, and even Puder didn't make it all the way.\n\n- **Someone who is half-Arabic writes in about the Muhammad Hassan character and complains about how WWE can't even be bothered to get the facts right**. Muhammad Hassan is an Arabic name but his manager Daivari is an Iranian name and Iranians aren't Arabs. Daivari speaks Farsi, which isn't even the same language and to pair them up as Arabic shows gross ignorance on WWE's part. Dave responds to the letter noting that this is the same company that makes Chinese food jokes about Japanese wrestlers, so expecting them to know or care about the differences between Arabic and Farsi or Iranians and Arabs is probably expecting too much.\n\n---\n\n***WEDNESDAY***: *Zero-ONE folding...sorta, Dick Ebersol plane crash, Kid Kash back to trashing TNA, more on Bob Holly/Rene Dupree situation, more Tough Enough drama, and more...*",

        "content": "I want this message to be heard by the devs who prowl here. I want Assassin’s Creed to redo what it did with Mirage to an extent and visit Edo/ Tokyo. \n\n\n\nAssassin’s Creed, since the very first game - thanks to efforts by Jade Raymond - has been very smart about reusing assets across games. This is great at offsetting costs while delivering regular installments. \n\n\n\nMirage appears to have attempted this, as it was originally meant as a DLC, but seems to have bloated in size and scope a bit during its long development. But I want to see you do that again. Limit the scope, schedule, and cost by a lot. You have a ton of assets from Shadows, and right now, with the announced and rumored Hexe, Invictus, Obsidian, and Nebula, there does not appear to be room for Shadow’s assets to be reused. And to be honest, I was disappointed by Shadows' cities. I felt robbed of what could have been, like the fan concepts from the past decade below.\n\n[Rising Sun Fan Concept](https://preview.redd.it/e4e02pu3jkaf1.jpg?width=1354&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b69147f9a144bc1f206fc0508b000c6082861201)\n\nBut Ubisoft, you have a ton of support studios. Mirage and Rogue were imperfect, but the teams, from the outside, appear to be agile and effective. Give a team another chance. Let Sofia, Bordeaux, or even Toronto loose with Quebec’s assets and make a game focused just on Tokyo in the late Edo period. New games always sell more than a DLC. So if Shadows has not met financial expectations, like Skull and Bones, an asset flip will help make back the losses. If Shadows did meet the financial expectations, then it’s proof that fans are hungry for Assassin’s Creed in Japan that could look like this:\n\n\n\n[Derek Weselake's concept](https://preview.redd.it/0pjpfw09jkaf1.jpg?width=1360&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f4dcd2e6fdb3885dc4d88290d20ff92ba404850)\n\nSo if you decide to move forward on this, which I’m hoping you were thinking about or doing before fan support, let me point out a few key things old school fans want and were disappointed by in Mirage:\n\n\n\n**1. Tokyo/ Edo only** \\- Do not include countryside. The desert of Mirage was inaccurate and pointless. Focus entirely on the city of Tokyo. If you feel you need to include Kyoto, please instance the cities separately. \n\n  \n\n\n**2. Built for parkour** \\- Mirage had better level design than any other AC game in the past decade. Keep it up, but build more densely and with a focus on parkour. The game needs to be built with parkour in mind. Animation cancelling, height gaining side and back ejects, the ability to begin those ejects at any point in the wall run, player driven movement. The character should jump automatically at the edge of a building while holding run + parkour. There need to be more NSOs, verticality that allows for more options, bars to swing on, corner swings, etc. Monkey bars and nice new animations are optional, but nice to have. Parkour purists like myself feel AC1 and 2 should be the standard for gameplay and control, not unity.\n\n  \n\n\n**3. A short linear story** \\- Mirage’s length was good. A 10-20 hour story is perfect. But many of the recent games, Valhalla, Mirage, and Shadows felt like their stories were kneecapped by non-linearity. Please, provide an amazing, linear narrative. Assassin’s Creed is at its best as a historical character-driven drama with the main character that is in the Assassins. Give us an Edward Kenway drama with an older, grizzled assassin who knows the job and has been doing it for as long as we have as players. Free tutorial idea (s)he is giving a training lesson to a recruit. Also, please don’t base the story on revenge. Let it be based on personal ideals in this changing world. It should also be a single main character, like Mirage.\n\n  \n\n\n**4. Minimal Gameplay Changes -** Mirage changed a lot. Shadows has a very good foundation. I would say, don’t change combat significantly. Maybe stuff like add a weapon or bigger changes to the main character’s loadout selection. The majority of the changes, in my opinion, should be focused on smoothing out Parkour and Stealth. The physical stealth of Shadows is the best in the series, but Ninjas also used social stealth. They pretended to be farmers and gardeners, which is why many of their tools are modified gardeners’ tools. Give us more of that. The subtlety, espionage, subterfuge and court drama within a tight cast of characters as the Templar ideology is attempting to rot away at the Shogunate or something like that. The Templar ideology is foreign and illegal and thus must be stealthy, just like us. Focus on what made Shadows so satisfying. \n\n  \n\n\n**5. World interactions** \\- Something that has felt lacking in the past number of games is how the world responds, or doesn’t, to you interacting with it. Climbing the side of a building should trigger comments and agitator NPCs, The streets should be crowded. By the 17th century, Tokyo had 500,000 people (as many as Paris in Unity), and by the 18th century it had a million. Mirage had a million people in Baghdad but often felt empty and dead. Please, get those crowd sizes back up a bit, and make social stealth viable. Let us disappear into a crowd of people. Let us use disguises to assist us. If you want to go far, let our weapon and gear loadouts affect social stealth. \n\n\n\n\n\n**TL;DR:** Shadows has issues but is a decent game. It’s beautiful, with great architecture, better parkour options than any other RPG game, and the best physical stealth in the series. Expand on this and asset flip for a quick buck while pleasing the old-school fans with a game in Edo period Tokyo.",

        "content": "Chiho Anjitsu, 20, was born into a loving family in Mato, an Ishikawa prefecture city close to Kanazawa. She was the second of three sisters and was known as a smart person among her friends.\nAs the vice president of the city's swimming organization, her father's enthusiasm for the sport must have been passed down to Chiho throughout her high school years. That's why she loved this sport as well. Her shelf was always full of trophies that she won.\nShe always had a habit of letting her family know of her whereabouts.\nBut that changed after a while. She stopped telling her family what she was up to. \n\nOn September 30, 1992, the day started much like any other.\nShe packed her homemade spaghetti lunchbox to eat in the afternoon between classes.\nStill, she ended up eating the spaghetti for dinner at the conclusion of her shift, right before 9:45 PM, since the swimming school staff surprised her by bringing lunch for them.\nThe mother became increasingly concerned when it got to 11 p.m. and decided to go look for her with her elder daughter.\nWhen the mother and sister arrived at the swimming school parking lot, they were shocked to see that Chiho's car was there in its regular spot-well, sort of — even though it was barely parked over space number three.\nThey hurried over to the car and saw that it had collided with the concrete block in front the spot.\n\nChiho was lying down on the completely reclined passenger seat when they peeked inside through the window. It was dark, and it was difficult to see anything clearly. They walked to the driver's side and unlocked the door after thinking she was asleep, and that's when they saw something wasn't quite right. They had attempted to rouse her up by unlocking the passenger seat door, but it was locked.\nWhen the mother switched on the inside light, she noticed that Chiho had dirt on her clothes and marks on her neck. She was also not breathing.\nChiho was, unfortunately, dead.\nPolice were dispatched to the location promptly, and throughout their coordination of the area and investigation, which lasted far into the morning of the next day, they made a number of noteworthy and peculiar findings.\nHer automobile was discovered half parked in space number three, even though she had reserved space number two.\n\nInvestigators deduced that the driver, who was not identified, had driven the car back to the parking lot before quickly leaving the area.\nUnknown fingerprints were removed from a cassette tape box located inside the dashboard and Chiho's shoulder bag with cash and other valuables was left on the back seat.\nThe wheels and lower portion of the car were covered in dirt, suggesting that it must have been driven off-road at some point, given that they were in the middle of an urban are:\nInvestigators don't believe that they belong to the suspect or that anything was taken, so the motive wasn't theft.\nThe mystery only grows deeper now that Chiho is involved, as the investigators were shocked by it.\n\nFirst, her right shoe was completely missing, and her left shoe was on the car's floor instead of on her foot.\nHer black top and blue denim overalls were completely covered in dirt, especially in the back. There was a small hole in the overalls' abdomen and groin area, but Chiho was unharmed. According to experts, the scars on her throat resembled those discovered in cases of suffocation and appeared to be the result of something compressing the throat.\nThe marks also extended oddly behind her ears, at the back of her lips, and down her throat.\nAlong with the dirt on the automobile, blades of grass and leaves suggested that something had occurred in a rural region.\n\nInvestigators found saliva on Chiho's upper body that belonged to a man with type A, B, or C blood.\nHer left cheek had marks consistent with physical trauma, and since foreign DNA was not found under her fingernails, they concluded that Chiho was not able to resist very much.\nUnfortunately, the forensic technology wasn't much advanced at that time.\nThe police also questioned one of her late-shift coworkers, who stated that she saw the car in the parking lot at approximately 9 p.m., indicating that the incident had to have occurred between 7:45 and 8:45 p.m.\n\nIn a book he published at the time, Torao Nishimura, the case's chief investigator, expressed his certainty that, of all the suspects, only one individual was responsible for this deed.\nSince Yamada was simply a suspect and never really charged with a crime, the book is unable to delve into extensive depth about him.\nStill, Toro provided some very interesting insights into this individual. Early on, Yamada was suspected of the crime and was even listed among 20 persons thought to be likely culprits.\nHowever, following an investigation and an interview, Yamada was able to provide a convincing alibi, leading to his removal from the investigation in May 1993, roughly six months after the incident.\nBut when it was discovered in June 1994 that he was the only one out of the 20 individuals whose blood type matched the saliva found on Chiho's body, police looked into him once\nUnfortunately, since DNA testing and profiling weren't very common in Japan in the early 1990s, the saliva sample wasn't preserved correctly.\nHowever, enough of the same blood type convinced the police to resume their pursuit of Yamada.\nUpon reexamining Yamada's Alibi, it was ascertained by a third party that he was not spotted at the location he claimed to be at between 7:15 and 8:50 p.m. on the day of the crime.\nPut differently, he had no explanation for the period between when Chiho left the pool and when her car was last spotted in the parking lot at 8:50.\n\nWhen this was discovered, the police, under the direction of Chief Investigator Torua, located the man and created a believable story to explain what had happened. After Chiho left work, she headed north towards Kanazawa City.\nAccording to Torau, based on where he was at the time, it is very likely that he met Chiho in a restaurant parking lot.\nThat day, a witness also saw a young man driving Chiho's car there, so it is likely that Yamada met Chiho there and drove her car while she was sitting in the passenger seat.\nTorau believes that after Chiho rejected Yamada's overtures to go to a hotel with him, he went to the agricultural research site located off the motel road and tried to do an egregious and sickening deed on her.\n\nThe markings on Chiho's neck did, in fact, match the fastenings of the strap, leading Torau to conclude that after a fight, Chiho left the car before Yamada caught up with her and strangled her.\nDespite all these findings, there was, unfortunately, no arrest and no closure to this case.\n\nTo be clear, all of this is only conjecture.\n\nUnfortunately, this case has already expired and remains unsolved to this day.",

        "content": "This paper presents an new approach for detecting in the electrical power system of satellites operating in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) without an Attitude Determination and Control Subsystem (ADCS). Components of these systems are prone to faults, such as line-to-line faults in the photovoltaic subsystem, open circuits, and short circuits in the DC-to-DC converter, as well as ground faults in batteries. In the previous research has largely focused on detecting faults in each components, such as photovoltaic arrays or converter systems, therefore, has been limited attention given to whole electrical power system of satellite as a whole system. Our approach addresses this gap by utilizing a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network model, which leverages input data such as solar radiation and surface temperature to predict current and load outputs. These machine learning techniques that classifiy use different approaches like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), to classify faults effectively. The model presented achieves over 99% accuracy in identifying faults across multiple subsystems, marking a notable advancement from previous approaches by offering a complete diagnostic solution for the entire satellite power system. This thorough method boosts system reliability and helps lower the chances of mission failure",

        "content": "The work in this paper describes the training and evaluation of machine learning (ML) techniques for the classification of cuneiform signs. There is a lot of variability in cuneiform signs, depending on where they come from, for what and by whom they were written, but also how they were digitized. This variability makes it unlikely that an ML model trained on one dataset will perform successfully on another dataset. This contribution studies how such differences impact that performance. Based on our results and insights, we aim to influence future data acquisition standards and provide a solid foundation for future cuneiform sign classification tasks. The ML model has been trained and tested on handwritten Old Babylonian (c. 2000-1600 B.C.E.) documentary texts inscribed on clay tablets originating from three Mesopotamian cities (Nippur, D\\=ur-Abie\\v{s}uh and Sippar). The presented and analysed model is ResNet50, which achieves a top-1 score of 87.1% and a top-5 score of 96.5% for signs with at least 20 instances. As these automatic classification results are the first on Old Babylonian texts, there are currently no comparable results.",

        "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13938v1",
        "content": "Recently, commercial ultra-wideband (UWB) transceivers have enabled not only measuring device-to-device distance but also tracking the position of a pedestrian who does not carry a UWB device. UWB-based device-free localization that does not require dedicated radar equipment is compatible with existing anchor infrastructure and can be reused to reduce hardware deployment costs. However, it is difficult to estimate the target's position accurately in real-world scenarios due to the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the cluttered environment. In this paper, we propose a deep learning (DL)-assisted particle filter to overcome these challenges. First, the channel impulse response (CIR) variance is analyzed to capture the variability induced by the target's movement. Then, a DL-based one-dimensional attention U-Net is used to extract only the reflection components caused by the target and suppress the noise components within the CIR variance profile. Finally, multiple preprocessed CIR variance profiles are used as input to a particle filter to estimate the target's position. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system is a practical and cost-effective solution for IoT and automotive applications with a root mean square error (RMSE) of about 15 cm and an average processing time of 4 ms. Furthermore, comparisons with existing state-of-the-art methods show that the proposed method provides the best performance with reasonable computational costs.",

Our proposed framework, which incorporates the notion of profit loss due to insufficient player participation, gives rise to a Tullock-like functional form of the stage payoff structure when weighted fair proportional resource allocation is applied. We explore both centralized and Nash equilibrium strategies, establish sufficient conditions for their existence and uniqueness, and provide an iterative, semi-decentralized method to compute the Nash equilibrium in games with arbitrarily many players. Additionally, we demonstrate that the framework generalizes instances of several existing models, including Receding Horizon and Blotto games, and present a semi-analytical method for computing the unique Nash equilibrium within the Blotto setup. Our findings are validated through a numerical case study in smart mobility, highlighting the practical relevance and applicability of the proposed model.",

        "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13803v1",
        "content": "Multi-modal fusion is crucial for Internet of Things (IoT) perception, widely deployed in smart homes, intelligent transport, industrial automation, and healthcare. However, existing systems often face challenges: high model complexity hinders deployment in resource-constrained environments, unidirectional modal alignment neglects inter-modal relationships, and robustness suffers when sensor data is missing. These issues impede efficient and robust multimodal perception in real-world IoT settings. To overcome these limitations, we propose GRAM-MAMBA. This framework utilizes the linear-complexity Mamba model for efficient sensor time-series processing, combined with an optimized GRAM matrix strategy for pairwise alignment among modalities, addressing the shortcomings of traditional single-modality alignment. Inspired by Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we introduce an adaptive low-rank layer compensation strategy to handle missing modalities post-training. This strategy freezes the pre-trained model core and irrelevant adaptive layers, fine-tuning only those related to available modalities and the fusion process. Extensive experiments validate GRAM-MAMBA's effectiveness. On the SPAWC2021 indoor positioning dataset, the pre-trained model shows lower error than baselines; adapting to missing modalities yields a 24.5% performance boost by training less than 0.2% of parameters. On the USC-HAD human activity recognition dataset, it achieves 93.55% F1 and 93.81% Overall Accuracy (OA), outperforming prior work; the update strategy increases F1 by 23% while training less than 0.3% of parameters. These results highlight GRAM-MAMBA's potential for achieving efficient and robust multimodal perception in resource-constrained environments.",

        "content": "Communication overhead remains a primary bottleneck in federated learning (FL), particularly for applications involving mobile and IoT devices with constrained bandwidth. This work introduces FedSkipTwin, a novel client-skipping algorithm driven by lightweight, server-side digital twins. Each twin, implemented as a simple LSTM, observes a client's historical sequence of gradient norms to forecast both the magnitude and the epistemic uncertainty of its next update. The server leverages these predictions, requesting communication only when either value exceeds a predefined threshold; otherwise, it instructs the client to skip the round, thereby saving bandwidth. Experiments are conducted on the UCI-HAR and MNIST datasets with 10 clients under a non-IID data distribution. The results demonstrate that FedSkipTwin reduces total communication by 12-15.5% across 20 rounds while simultaneously improving final model accuracy by up to 0.5 percentage points compared to the standard FedAvg algorithm. These findings establish that prediction-guided skipping is a practical and effective strategy for resource-aware FL in bandwidth-constrained edge environments.",

        "content": "Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) combined with Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) techniques forms the backbone of modern wireless communication systems. While offering high spectral efficiency and robustness, conventional MIMO-OFDM, especially with complex equalizers like Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE), suffers from high Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) and significant power consumption due to multiple active Radio Frequency (RF) chains. This paper proposes and mathematically models an alternative system, termed Multi-Dimensional OFDM (MD-OFDM), which employs a per-subcarrier transmit antenna selection strategy. By activating only one transmit antenna for each subcarrier, MD-OFDM aims to reduce PAPR, lower power consumption, and improve Bit Error Rate (BER) performance. We provide detailed mathematical formulations for BER, Energy Efficiency (EE), and PAPR, and discuss the suitability of MD-OFDM for various applications, particularly in energy-constrained and cost-sensitive scenarios such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN). Simulation results demonstrate that MD-OFDM achieves superior BER and significantly lower PAPR compared to MMSE MIMO, albeit with a trade-off in peak overall energy efficiency due to reduced spectral multiplexing.",
